# sharef-repo-all-projects
This is my repository for all my projects and progress.
Below is a list in no particular order of all the topics that I will be exploring as 
I acquire more skills and knowledge in various fields of Information Technology.

~~<em>I haven't made my portfolio public because I do not want other users to add or modify my code as I practice.
That may be my ignorance speaking but I am new and unsure of what to publicize. 
Thank you for your understanding.</em>~~ AAAAAHHHH YEEEEAH! I'm public! 
Super excited to finally be really puting myself to task and learning all that I can.
